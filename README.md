##CV.AI
This was my part of cv.ai, which takes in lecture slides and other information, such as notes and generates a cv based on the notes and skills that you have learnt in your classes. It then matches it to jobs and creates a cover letter based on what it needed. It also gives you a percentage on how likely you are to get a job.
